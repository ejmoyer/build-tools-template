# Basic Build Tool Template

This project is a template that you can use for basic HTML and CSS editing. You need `node` and `npm` installed globally on your machine in order to run these commands, but everything else will be installed locally by `npm` into the `node_modules/` directory.


## Instructions

1. Clone this repository so you have the files locally.
2. Copy the following files to your new project's root directory:
  1. `package.json`
  2. `gulpfile.js`
  3. `.gitignore`
3. Run `npm install` from inside your project directory to get the dependencies.
4. Run `npm start` to serve your website!

The server will look for any HTML and CSS files in your project directory and you can view it in your browser at [http://localhost:3000/](). As you change your site files, it will check them for correctness and reload the page for you.

Press `ctrl-c` to cancel the server. You can start it up again with `npm start` at any time.
